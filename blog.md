I am interested in blogging about psychiatric genomics, sleep research, statistical models used in genomics, ML methods in research, productivity & being a PhD student.. some ideas:

- How lockdown completely changed my work.
- The power of pomodoro.
- How psychiatric genomics is overlooked.
- The power of psychiatric genomics
- A discussion of lockdown productivity.
- Changing my mind about starting a PhD.
