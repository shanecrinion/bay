<p>
  Welcome! I'm Shane, a PhD student in Genomics Data Science at <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/">NUI Galway</a>. My research investigates the shared genetics and causal role of sleep in neuropsychiatric disorders. At Genomics Medicine Ireland (now <a href="https://genuitysci.com/">Genuity Science</a>), I completed a bioinformatics internship before starting <a href="https://genomicsdatascience.ie/">my PhD programme</a>, at the SFI Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science. </p>

<p>
I live in Galway, Ireland. In my free time I like to read, sea swim and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cPWgT6rDvBUqDzw19">travel</a>.
